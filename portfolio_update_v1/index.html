        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I’m an aspiring web developer going the self taught route. I love to learn and see what programming can actually build and create. When I am not coding I am working as a nurse.</p>
        <p>I am currently a Techdegree student at <a href="https://join.teamtreehouse.com/techdegree/" target="_blank" class="linkcolor">Treehouse</a> and I highly recommend the program if you are trying to build a better life.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I would like to be employed and working as a programmer in one years time, so by May of 2020. These are some of the languages that I am currently trying to learn.</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Ruby</li>
          <li>Rails</li>
          <li>Python</li>
        </ul>
        <p>My hope is to start working as a web developer or programmer while also going back to school to get my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering at ASU. The end goal is to one day work for Google.</p>
