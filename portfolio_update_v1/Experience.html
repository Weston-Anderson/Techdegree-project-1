        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>Currently I am a Techdegree student at <a href="https://join.teamtreehouse.com/techdegree/" target="_blank" class="linkcolor">Treehouse</a> building projects that are required for completion. However, I also have purchased several books related to coding and have been reading them trying to teach myself and learn as much as I can about code. I am 
        looking forward very much to getting my first programming position.</p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>Here are some of my hobbies when I am not working</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Walking</li>
          <li>Reading, especially Steven King books.</li>
          <li>Coding</li>
        </ul>
        <p>My hope is to start working as a web developer or programmer while also going back to school to get my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering at ASU. The end goal is to one day work for Google.</p>
